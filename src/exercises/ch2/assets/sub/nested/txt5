Plainview: Are you an angry man, Henry?

Henry: About what?

Plainview: Are you envious? D'you get envious?

Henry: I don't think so. No.

Plainview: I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.

Henry: That part of me is gone. Working and not succeeding- all my, uh... failures has left me, uh... I just don't... care.

Plainview: Well, if it's in me, it's in you. There are times when I... I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone.

Henry: What will you do about your boy?

Plainview: I don't know. Uhhhh, maybe it'll change. Does your sound come back to you? I don't know. Maybe no one knows that. A doctor might not know that.

Henry: Where's his mother?

Plainview: I don't want to talk about those things. I see the worst in people, Henry. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little. Having you here gives me a second breath of life. I can't keep doing this on my own... with these, umm... people.
